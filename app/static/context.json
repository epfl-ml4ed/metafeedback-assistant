  "problem": "Let $x$ be a real number. Prove that if $x^2$ is irrational, then $x$ is irrational using:a) a proof by contraposition b) a proof by contradictionDetail the two proofs in a way that shows that you understood the difference between a proof by contraposition and a proof by contradiction.",
  "solution": "1. CONTRAPOSITION: WE HAVE TO SHOW IF X IS RATIONAL THEN X² IS RATIONAL: 1) x is rational : x = p/q where p and q are both rational numbers 2) x = p/q -> x² = p²/q² 3) As p and q are rational, p² and q² are also rational so x² is the quotient of 2 rational numbers. 4) Therefore x² is rational 5) By contraposition, we can say if x² is irrational then x is irrational 2. CONTRADICTION  WE HAVE TO SHOW (X² IS IRRATIONAL IMPLIES X IS RATIONAL) IS A CONTRADICTION : 1. x^2 is irrational    2. x is rational    3. x = p / q    4. x^2 = p^2 / q^2    5. x^2 is rational    Then this statement contradicts our assumption that x^2 is irrational, so such an x does not exist."
